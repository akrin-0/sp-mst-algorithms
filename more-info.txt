Story: Mecnun and Leyla are two lovers who live in the Anatolian country. They try to come
together but Leyla’s father is preventing them from doing so. Recently Leyla has tried to con-
vince her father and she eventually manages to do. But her father offers a condition for Mecnun
that he has to reach their town in time less than or equal to a threshold. The father sets the
threshold and writes it to a piece of paper and hides the paper. Mecnun will be informed about
the challenge but he will not be provided any information about the time that was set. The
countdown for Mecnun will start at the moment he departs from his city and if he can arrive
in time Leyla’s father will let them marry. Mecnun has a map of the Anatolian country which
demonstrates all land routes over the country and their lengths. The country is divided into
two regions by a river. Leyla and Mecnun are in the same region of the country but in different
cities. Leyla’s city is the only city in the country where there are bridges for crossing to the
other side of the country. For this reason, anyone who wants to cross over to the other side
should visit this city.
    Two cities can be considered neighboring cities if there is a road between them. The roads
of the country are one-way for the vehicles and two-ways for the pedestrians. Mecnun will take
a bus while going to Leyla to be able to reach fast. Each road has a bus service of its own
and there is always a bus service available at any given time. Every bus has the same constant
velocity.
    Mecnun and Leyla are planning a honeymoon in which they would be traveling on foot to
all the cities of the other side of the country. But each pedestrian has to pay a sidewalk-tax
which is equal to the length of the road. If they can’t find a decent travel route for their plan,
they will have to stay in the city where Leyla lives.

• For each case output consists of a list of integers and one integer, list1 and int1. List1
indicates the output generated for Mecnun’s path to reach Leyla. int1 indicates the output
generated for the Honeymoon path.

• Mecnun does not know the time set by the father, so he must take the shortest possible
route. The shortest route to be used in list1 should be containing the IDs of the cities
passed starting from Mecnun’s city to Leyla’s city. If there is no route from Mecnun’s
city to Leyla’s city, list1 should contain only -1.

• When Mecnun tries to reach Leyla’s city, he cannot get over the bridge. On the hon-
eymoon, they can only visit Leyla’s city + cities of other side of the country. (For the
sample map illustrated in Schema 1, only c7, d1, d2, d3, and d4 cities can be visited on
the honeymoon.)

• If Mecnun can reach Leyla, Leyla’s father will compare the time he arrived with the time
on the paper and come to a decision. Since the speed of the buses is 1br/second, the
arrival time is equal to the total length of the path.

• Mecnun and Leyla are planning to walk around all the cities of the other side of the
country and have the walkthrough honeymoon with the lowest sidewalk-tax. The roads
traveled are subject to a sidewalk-tax proportional to their length, and after the tax is
paid once, subsequent uses of the road are free of charge. In this case, the length of the
path they walk does not matter. The sidewalk-tax paid must be the lowest and the route
must include all cities of the other side of the country. The tax paid by Mecnun will be
the int1 part of the output.

• If there is no such honeymoon route, Mecnun stays in Leyla’s city and int1 should be -2.

• If they cannot get married, Mecnun disappears as per the legend. In this case int1 should
be -1.

Input format (examine sample):
8                            | Time(weight) limit determined by Leyla’s father is 8.
11                           | The country has 11 cities. IDs start with c represents the cities of the side where Leyla and Mecnun lives and IDs start with d represents the cities of the other side of the country.
c1 c7                        | The city of Mecnun and the city of Leyla respectively.
c1 c2 1 c3 3 c5 5            | City c1 is connected to c2, c3 and c5 with weights of 1,3 and 4 respectively.
c2 c4 6 c5 3 c6 5            | City c2 is connected to c4, c5 and c6 with weights of 6,3 and 4 respectively.
c3 c4 2 c6 2                 | City c3 is connected to c4, c6 with weights of 2 and 2 respectively.
c4 c7 3                      | City c4 is connected to c7 with weight of 3.
c5 c7 2                      | City c5 is connected to c7 with weight of 2.
c6 c7 1                      | City c6 is connected to c7 with weight of 1.
c7 d1 2 d2 3 d4 5            | City c7 is connected to d1, d2 and d4 with weights of 2,3 and 5 respectively.
d1 d2 4 d3 2 d4 3            | City d1 is connected to d2, d3, and d4 with weights of 4,2 and 3 respectively.
d2 d3 1                      | City d2 is connected to d3 with weight of 4.
d3 d4 4                      | City d3 is connected to d4 with weight of 4.
d4 d2 4                      | City d4 is connected to d2 with weight of 4.

Output format (examine sample):
c1 c2 c5 c7 or c1 c3 c6 c7 | The path that Mecnun can reach Leyla. Since there are two paths with the same minimum length of 6, any of them is accepted.
16                         | The side-walk tax paid on the Honeymoon route. (c7,d1), (d1,d4), (d1,d3) and (d2,d3) ways are used so (2+3+2+1)*2=16. (Doubling since both Leyla and Mecnun travel.)
